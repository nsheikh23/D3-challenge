## Background

Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml), but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## Task
Constructed an interactive scatter plot that displayed relationships between all the factors recorded in the data provided. For details on each scatter point, a tooltip was added.

## Analysis

Examining the relationship between poverty and lacking healthcare, it is possible to see a positive correlation. As the poverty percentage increases, the higher the percentage of people lacking healthcare. This is as expected because the states that have a lower poverty rate, have a greater population that can work and afford healthcare.

Following up on the last point, if comparing median household income and lacking healthcare, it can be clearly seen that majority of the states that have high uninsured people also have low household income. Very few states actually have high household income as well as uninsured population percentage. That may be due to higher cost of living in the state, however in general it is an indirect relationship thus supporting the point made earlier.

In another interesting analysis, it can be seen from the Age vs. Smokes that majority of the states are clumped together in the middle of chart. This means, most states have relatively similar patterns when it comes to age and smoking. Less than a quarter of each state populate smokes between the median ages of 36-40.

As for obesity, there is a negative correlation with median household income. At first, it seems strange there is a higher obesity percentage with lower household income. However, diving deeper, it kind of makes sense. People with higher household income may be more self conscious about their health, their diet and fitness. They are able to afford eating healthier and joining fitness programs. Whereas, lower income households do not have that luxury, and they can only afford fastfood restaurants and lower quality foods that lead to obesity. Moreover, they
may not have the time or financial means to think of fitness as they are always focused on surviving.
